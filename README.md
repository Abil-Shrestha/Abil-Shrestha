Hello! I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science.
I have several years of experience programming with Typescript, Python, JavaScript, and C/C++. Iâ€™m currently interested in learning how to incorporate machine learning in our day-to-day tasks.
Feel free to reach out to me for any inquiries!
